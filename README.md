# blocky_starter

My first blockchain app

Follows tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH9Q2lf2mNo from Dapp University.

Blockchain app using:

Etherum
Web3.js (library for communicating with the blockchain)
Solidity Smart Contracts

Ganache (framework for local blockchain, ran using ganache-cli and ganache GUI as per tutorial above)
Truffle (suite of tools for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts)

Metamask for Chrome (used for wallet)

Mocha (tests)
Chai (assertions)

# Installation

To install first clone down the repo, then run "npm intall" to get the dependancies. You will need an Ethereum account, I used MetaMask. If running as a test network, you may want to use Ganache. Otherwise, deployment on Kovan will require some extra work.

Please note, this is a test project I made for learning purposes, and is not intended for commerical use.
